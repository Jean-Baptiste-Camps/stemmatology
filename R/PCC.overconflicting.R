    ## We show centrality distribution visually. Other methods possible?

    ## For the moment, pam works very well with 4 classes, at least
    ## on Chevalier au Lyon
    ## (makes sense : 1 class for over-conflicting, one for non
    ## assessables, one for sobers, and one for non-conflicting).
    ### With 3 classes, works very well too, in the sense that the 2
    ### firs clusters group together.
    ### Maybe look at ClustOfVar (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0295v1.pdf)
