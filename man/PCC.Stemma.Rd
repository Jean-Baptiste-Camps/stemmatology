\arguments{
  \item{x}{

}
  \item{omissionsAsReadings}{
     logical; if \code{TRUE}, omissions are treated as variant readings. They are taken into account in determining conflicts between variant locations or in computing severe disagreements between witnesses).
     
     Default: \code{FALSE}.
}
  \item{limit}{
The maximum number of severe disagreements expected for witnesses to be in the same group. 

    Default: \code{0}.
}
 \item{recoverNAs}{
  logical; if \code{TRUE}, when an actual witness or reconstructed subarchetype is identified to the reconstructed model of a group, every NA it has is recovered by taking the value of the reconstructed model; if \code{FALSE}, their NAs values are kept. 
  
  Default: \code{TRUE}.
